# Jot It (Deprecated)

Deprecation Notice: I stopped using this application since I shifted over to Obsidian for my note-taking needs, whether it's short-lived notes or otherwise. The production app has been taken down.

Jot It is a note-taking web app focused on simplicity and efficiency. It doesn't try to accommodate every single use case for note taking, rather it focuses on just one thing: jotting down short-lived notes quickly. 

Through specializing in this use case, Jot It is performant and efficient to use through its optimistic updates on every action and keyboard shortcuts that let you just start typing instead of fiddling with typography or structure. Moreover, this allows Jot It to be used effectively with other note-taking apps to optimize your note-taking workflow by using the right tool for the right job. Need to take rough notes during a meeting? Fire up Jot It and start typing in less than 2 keystrokes. Writing up formal notes as you go through a textbook? Grab a markdowm-based note-taking app to organize the structure of your notes perfectly.

To maximize efficiency, my goal is to allow this to be used without the need to log in with the core functionality.
